//Challenge 3: The "Media Organizer" 🧹
//The Setup: Create a function called organizeFiles. Your script should do the following:
//Read the folder: Read a folder called downloads.
//Identify and Act:
//If a file ends in .png or .jpg, rename it to include the prefix image- (e.g., vacation.jpg becomes image-vacation.jpg).
//If a file ends in .pdf, delete it (we don't want those anymore!).
//If a file ends in .json, read the file, log its contents to the console, and then move it into a sub-folder called data.
//Use path.extname() to determine which file is which.
//Use async/await to keep the logic clean and sequential.
